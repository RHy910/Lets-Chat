# Chat app ðŸ’¬ using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io)

a chat application using Express, Websockets. Tough you can use plain websockets but I am using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around Websockets, its super easy to use and provies a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.
